BetterBoots
===========
Craft boots that give you different Abilities! These boots deteriorate with usage, requiring one to craft them again. There will be 5 different kinds of boots:

FlightBoots: These boots will give the wearer the ability to fly while worn! Speed and whether or not to use Built-in Durability are configurable in the config. (Diamond)

SneakBoots: These boots will make the wearer invisible while sneaking! Goes great with PickPocket!(Leather)

HeavyBoots: These boots will make the wearer immune to knockback effects! (Iron)

SpeedBoots: These boots will give the wearer the ability to run incredibly fast! (Gold)

IceBoots: These boots will allow the player to walk on water by creating ice under their feet as they walk! (Chainmail)

This plugin is still being developed. Look forward to it soon!
